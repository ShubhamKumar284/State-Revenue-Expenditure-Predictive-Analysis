# State-Revenue-Expenditure-Predictive-Analysi
Predictive analysis of state-wise revenue expenditure using machine learning techniques on Indian government budget data. The project applies regression, classification, decision trees, and clustering to analyze spending patterns, evaluate model performance, and identify trends in public sector expenditure.


🎯 Project Objectives
Objective 1: Revenue Expenditure Prediction (Regression)

To predict state-wise revenue expenditure using supervised learning regression techniques based on historical Indian government budget data.

Algorithms Used

Simple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

Rationale

Revenue expenditure is a continuous variable.

Historical budget components act as effective predictors.

This objective aligns with supervised learning regression problems.

Evaluation Metrics

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score

Objective 2: Spending Behavior Classification

To classify Indian states as over-spending or under-spending based on their revenue expenditure patterns.

Class Definition

Over-spending: Actual expenditure > Average expenditure

Under-spending: Actual expenditure ≤ Average expenditure

Algorithms Used

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naïve Bayes

Rationale

The target variable is categorical in nature.

Enables financial behavior analysis and decision support.
